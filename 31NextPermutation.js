// Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the
// lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

// If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it
// as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

// The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

// Example 1:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3]
// Output: [1,3,2]

// Example 2:
// Input: nums = [3,2,1]
// Output: [1,2,3]

// Example 3:
// Input: nums = [1,1,5]
// Output: [1,5,1]

// Example 4:
// Input: nums = [1]
// Output: [1]

// I've looked at some solutions, and realized that I really don't like this question.
// It's a question that requires you know the math for how to get the next one already.
// It's pretty complex, and I don't think I'd be able to solve this on a coding interview...
